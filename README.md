# Hawkeye

## Screenshot support

Hawkeye can capture page screenshots without relying on external Go-based tools. Pass
`--screenshot-engine pyppeteer` to use the bundled headless Chromium controller from
[`pyppeteer`](https://github.com/pyppeteer/pyppeteer). Install the dependency with
`pip install pyppeteer` when you need screenshot support.
